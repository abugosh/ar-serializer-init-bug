== README

This failing test shows that an empty serialized column is marked as changed on initialization instead of being left as nil.

The bug is at https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-0-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L462 where the attribute is compared directly instead of being obtained via: clone_attribute_value(:read_attribute, attr)
